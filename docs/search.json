    "text": "My first assignment has two parts.\n\n\nAccording to Mustafa Baydo??an, we, as industrial engineers, frequently encounter optimization problems. There are tools we have learned to solve these problems, the most important of which is mathematical modeling. Recently, methods have started to be taught on the data mining and analysis side.\nAccording to his experience with a company dealing with lumber, as industrial engineers, we can be a bridge between the problem and the solution. From the moment he first heard about the company’s problem, he investigated the problem in detail and tried to understand it. This made those experiencing the problem feel understood. Again, from this story, it is seen that we can work with many different disciplines.\nLater, Mr. Baydo??an talked about the importance of estimating production and consumption in the electricity market and showed us the great damages that wrong estimations will cause. He also explained the differences between deep learning and traditional learning and discussed how to solve these estimation problems.\nHe stated that many applications collect data from us in addition to the service they provide to us and take their positions according to this data.\nFinally, he concluded his words by saying that, in his opinion, the best way to learn is to get our hands dirty and get involved.\nQUESTION 1- What is the correct order of the decision-making process? a) Goal Setting - Determining the Possible Cause of the Problem - Collecting the necessary information about the Problem - Identifying Alternatives and Selecting the Most Effective Solution b) Identifying Alternatives and Selecting the Most Effective Solution - Goal Setting - Collecting the necessary information about the Problem - Determining the Possible Cause of the Problem c) Goal Setting - Collecting the necessary information about the Problem - Identifying Alternatives and Selecting the Most Effective Solution - Determining the Possible Cause of the Problem d) Determining the Possible Cause of the Problem - Collecting the necessary information about the Problem - Identifying Alternatives and Selecting the Most Effective Solution - Goal Setting\nQUESTION 2- What do Industrial Engineers usually deal with in their work? Answer: Industrial engineers frequently encounter optimization problems in their professional lives. They learn various tools to solve these problems, with mathematical modeling being one of them. Problems that cannot be solved through deterministic methods are addressed using statistical or stochastic approaches. In the past decade, data mining has also become one of these essential tools.\n\n\n\nSTEP 1 # We need to install the ‘dslabs’ library and save the polls_us_election_2016.\n\nlibrary(dslabs)\ndata(polls_us_election_2016)\n\nSTEP 2 # Display the first 10 rows.\n\nfirst_ten_rows &lt;- head(polls_us_election_2016,10)\nprint(first_ten_rows)\n\n        state  startdate    enddate\n1        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n2        U.S. 2016-11-01 2016-11-07\n3        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n4        U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n5        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n6        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n7        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n8        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-05\n9  New Mexico 2016-11-06 2016-11-06\n10       U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n                                                     pollster grade samplesize\n1                                    ABC News/Washington Post    A+       2220\n2                                     Google Consumer Surveys     B      26574\n3                                                       Ipsos    A-       2195\n4                                                      YouGov     B       3677\n5                                            Gravis Marketing    B-      16639\n6  Fox News/Anderson Robbins Research/Shaw & Company Research     A       1295\n7                                     CBS News/New York Times    A-       1426\n8                                NBC News/Wall Street Journal    A-       1282\n9                                                    Zia Poll  &lt;NA&gt;       8439\n10                                                   IBD/TIPP    A-       1107\n   population rawpoll_clinton rawpoll_trump rawpoll_johnson rawpoll_mcmullin\n1          lv           47.00         43.00            4.00               NA\n2          lv           38.03         35.69            5.46               NA\n3          lv           42.00         39.00            6.00               NA\n4          lv           45.00         41.00            5.00               NA\n5          rv           47.00         43.00            3.00               NA\n6          lv           48.00         44.00            3.00               NA\n7          lv           45.00         41.00            5.00               NA\n8          lv           44.00         40.00            6.00               NA\n9          lv           46.00         44.00            6.00               NA\n10         lv           41.20         42.70            7.10               NA\n   adjpoll_clinton adjpoll_trump adjpoll_johnson adjpoll_mcmullin\n1         45.20163      41.72430        4.626221               NA\n2         43.34557      41.21439        5.175792               NA\n3         42.02638      38.81620        6.844734               NA\n4         45.65676      40.92004        6.069454               NA\n5         46.84089      42.33184        3.726098               NA\n6         49.02208      43.95631        3.057876               NA\n7         45.11649      40.92722        4.341786               NA\n8         43.58576      40.77325        5.365788               NA\n9         44.82594      41.59978        7.870127               NA\n10        42.92745      42.23545        6.316175               NA\n\n\nSTEP 3 # Calculate and display the total number of NA values in the entire data set. # I used the sum and is.na functions. is.na function returns a 1 or 0 value, and the sum function sums them.\n\ntotal_na &lt;- sum(is.na(polls_us_election_2016))\nprint(paste(\"Total NA values:\", total_na))\n\n[1] \"Total NA values: 11604\"\n\n\nSTEP 4 # Replace all NA values in the ???polls_us_election_2016??? data set as follows: For numeric columns, replace NA values with your birth year.
